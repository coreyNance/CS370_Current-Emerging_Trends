# CS370_Current-Emerging_Trends

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

Basically the objective of this project was to create and train an AI to be able to solve a treasure finding challenge. Most of the code for this project was already done with the only part needing to be completed being the Q-Training Algorithm part. The given parts of the code started with first the imported libraries. Then the array to create the maze object along with the helper function that allows for a visual representation of the maze object.  The next given code block creates the functionality to give the pirate agent to move up, down, left, and right throughout the environment along with a code block that creates the reward and another block that creates the TreasureMaze object and the starting positon of the pirate. Along with code to test the model.  


# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

The biggest connection from this course and the fied of computer science I would think would come in when one thinks about automation or embedded code. Any task that a computer may take over and run on its own or in the background would be a direct connection to what is learned in this course.  Mainly because most of the computers that will handle these tasks would have some type of learning involved. 




# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

"They use data science, robotics and computer programming principles to create or improve computer systems, software and algorithms and sometimes work with electrical and computer hardware engineers on complex projects" (Cote , 2022).

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach prolems by first bring it down to the basics.  Remember back to the example as to how would you explain a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Most people skip right to the part of putting the peanut butter and jelly but forgetting the smaller details like where is the peanut butter located? Is it on a plate? and What are you using to apply the spreads? These questions and many more like it help to break down a problem into simple steps. 




# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

To try and develop a program that is user friendly without any bias.  A program being able to complete a task is not important if the end user can't use the program.  Just like the average person knows how to operate a car but they don't know all the innter workings.  If they had to know about the entire workings of a car to operate it, the car would not be a good option.
